REASONS WHY ITERATION 2 PREDICTS BETTER:

1.	The above prediction improved since more training image was added. Also, I added more batman goodie images with blues and reds so that the model can be trained to detect batman images apart from just color classification. This helped the classifier predict and detect batman image with blues and reds better. 
2.	Reason why superman goodie image was detected with higher accuracy was because, I trained the model with more images of superman goodie images of jewelry like the test data. This made the model detect ‘S’ shaped jewelry items better from the test data.
3.	Usually ML and Data Mining algorithm work better with more data, here 45 is still a small number, to get the best results with this algorithm large dataset would have helped.
